often convincing was having an argument  I dislike arguments of any kind  They are Lady Bracknell  This noise is extremely unpleasant  It sounds as if he Chasuble  Your guardian has a very emotional nature Cecily  Uncle Jack seems strangely agitated one looks up Noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about  Every supposed to occur  They are hardly considered the thing tell you

Victoria  The Brighton line  Sinks into Jack  What railway station stations in London Miss Prism  I left it in the cloakroom of one of the larger railway infant insist on knowing where you deposited the handbag that contained that Jack  Miss Prism this is a matter of no small importance to me  I Miss Prism  Do not ask me Mr Worthing the handbag Jack  Who has been listening attentively  But where did you deposit and placed the baby in the handbag never can forgive myself I deposited the manuscript in the basinette few unoccupied hours  In a moment of mental abstraction for which I place the manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my with me a somewhat old but capacious handbag in which I had intended to prepared as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator  I had also of the day you mention a day that is for ever branded on my memory I only wish I did  The plain facts of the case are these  On the morning Miss Prism  Lady Bracknell I admit with shame that I do

sentimentality  Miss remote corner of Bayswater  It contained the manuscript of a the perambulator was discovered at midnight standing by itself in a later through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police that contained a baby of the male sex  You never returned  A few weeks house Number  Upper Grosvenor Street in charge of a perambulator scandal  Twentyeight years ago Prism you left Lord Bracknells shield Cecily and Gwendolen from hearing the details of a terrible public Canon starts back in horror  Algernon and Jack pretend to be anxious to humble manner  Prism  Where is that baby  General consternation  The her head in shame  Come here Prism  Miss Prism approaches in a Lady Bracknell  In a severe judicial voice  Prism  Miss Prism bows escape Prism grows pale and quails  She looks anxiously round as if desirous to sight of Lady Bracknell who has fixed her with a stony glare  Miss have been waiting for you there for an hour and threequarters  Catches Miss Prism  I was told you expected me in the vestry dear Canon  I Enter Miss Prism hurriedly Chasuble  Looking off  She approaches she is nigh Let her be sent for Lady Bracknell  In spite of what I hear of her I must see her at once three years Miss Cardews esteemed governess and valued companion Jack  Interposing  Miss Prism Lady Bracknell has been for the last Chasuble  Severely  I am a celibate madam position she holds in your household Lady Bracknell  It is obviously the same person  May I ask what and the very picture of respectability Chasuble  Somewhat indignantly  She is the most cultivated of ladies education this Miss Prism a female of repellent aspect remotely connected with may prove to be one of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself  Is Lady Bracknell  Pray allow me to detain you for a moment  This matter Chasuble  Yes Lady Bracknell  I am on my way to join her Prism Lady Bracknell  Starting  Miss Prism  Did I hear you mention a Miss vestry for the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in the church at once  Indeed I have just been informed by the pewopener that present mood seems to be one peculiarly secular I will return to the completely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons  However as your They savour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists views that I have Chasuble  I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you Mr Worthing practical value to either of us Dr Chasuble Jack  I dont think that as things are now it would be of much at all this afternoon Chasuble  Am I to understand then that there are to be no christenings way in which you wasted your time and money Lord Bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned that that was the Algernon I forbid you to be baptized  I will not hear of such excesses Lady Bracknell  At their age  The idea is grotesque and irreligious Both these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism Chasuble  Looking rather puzzled and pointing to Jack and Algernon Lady Bracknell  The christenings sir  Is not that somewhat premature Chasuble  Everything is quite ready for the christenings Enter Dr Chasuble trains  To miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform Come dear Gwendolen rises we have already missed five if not six Algernon of course can choose for himself  Pulls out her watch Lady Bracknell  That is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen to Jack  Then a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward aware that what you propose is out of the question Lady Bracknell  Rising and drawing herself up  You must be quite gladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward hands  The moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen I will most Jack  But my dear Lady Bracknell the matter is entirely in your own you to reconsider your decision to say seems to me to show a somewhat impatient natureI would beg of that she cannot wait till she is thirtyfivea remark which I am bound Lady Bracknell  My dear Mr Worthing as Miss Cardew states positively Cecily  I dont know Mr Moncrieff Algernon  Then what is to be done Cecily others and waiting even to be married is quite out of the question cross  I am not punctual myself I know but I do like punctuality in I hate waiting even five minutes for anybody  It always makes me rather Cecily  Yes I felt it instinctively but I couldnt wait all that time Algernon  Of course I could Cecily  You know I could Cecily  Algy could you wait for me till I was thirtyfive is at present  There will be a large accumulation of property should not be even still more attractive at the age you mention than she forty which was many years ago now  I see no reason why our dear Cecily knowledge she has been thirtyfive ever since she arrived at the age of five for years  Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point  To my own very highest birth who have of their own free choice remained thirty five is a very attractive age  London society is full of women of the Lady Bracknell  That does not seem to me to be a grave objection  Thirty will Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirtyfive is only fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfathers Jack  Pray excuse me Lady Bracknell for interrupting you again but it importance I dont think your guardians consent is after all a matter of any long before you are of age and free from the restraints of tutelage  So but admitting to twenty at evening parties  Well it will not be very age  It looks so calculating    In a meditative manner  Eighteen alteration  Indeed no woman should ever be quite accurate about her Lady Bracknell  You are perfectly right in making some slight when I go to evening parties Cecily  Well I am really only eighteen but I always admit to twenty over  How old are you dear Lady Bracknell  To Cecily  Come here sweet child  Cecily goes however is unalterable  I decline to give my consent Jack  That is very generous of you Lady Bracknell  My own decision decided entirely to overlook my nephews conduct to you Lady Bracknell  Ahem  Mr Worthing after careful consideration I have myself yesterday afternoon intend to have a brother not even of any kind  I distinctly told him so that I have no brother that I never had a brother and that I dont the more heartless is that he was perfectly well aware from the first tea and devoured every single muffin  And what makes his conduct all alienating the affections of my only ward  He subsequently stayed to disgraceful deception he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in Brut  wine I was specially reserving for myself  Continuing his been informed by my butler an entire pint bottle of my PerrierJouet pretence of being my brother  Under an assumed name he drank Ive just of romance he obtained admission to my house by means of the false afternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important question Jack  I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter  This Oxonian Lady Bracknell  Untruthful  My nephew Algernon  Impossible  He is an and Cecily look at him in indignant amazement all of his moral character  I suspect him of being untruthful  Algernon Bracknell about your nephew but the fact is that I do not approve at Jack  It pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you Lady but he looks everything  What more can one desire I may almost say an ostentatiously eligible young man  He has nothing Lady Bracknell  Upon what grounds may I ask  Algernon is an extremely consent I absolutely decline to give and she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age  That engagement is quite out of the question  I am Miss Cardews guardian Jack  I beg your pardon for interrupting you Lady Bracknell but this others character before marriage which I think is never advisable engagements  They give people the opportunity of finding out each Lady Bracknell  To speak frankly I am not in favour of long Cecily  Thank you Aunt Augusta Algernon  Thank you Aunt Augusta Lady Bracknell  The marriage I think had better take place quite soon Cecily  Thank you Aunt Augusta Lady Bracknell  You may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future Cecily  Kisses her  Thank you Lady Bracknell Lady Bracknell  Cecily you may kiss me Algernon  Thank you Aunt Augusta consent of allowing that to stand in my way  Well I suppose I must give my Bracknell I had no fortune of any kind  But I never dreamed for a moment But I do not approve of mercenary marriages  When I married Lord course you know that Algernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon people who cant get into it do that  To Cecily  Dear child of Lady Bracknell  Never speak disrespectfully of Society Algernon  Only world  And I dont care twopence about social possibilities Algernon  Cecily is the sweetest dearest prettiest girl in the whole profile Lady Bracknell  There are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardews Algernon  Yes Aunt Augusta very high just at present  Algernon dear  Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn  They are worn its want of principle and its want of profile  The chin a little higher social possibilities in your profile  The two weak points in our age are presents her profile  Yes quite as I expected  There are distinct turns completely round  No the side view is what I want  Cecily practised smile to Cecily  Kindly turn round sweet child  Cecily Lady Bracknell  Glares at Jack for a few moments  Then bends with a Jack  And after six months nobody knew her and after three months her own husband did not know her brief space of time  I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing experienced French maid produces a really marvellous result in a very Nature might have left it  But we can soon alter all

to say in an age of the present day have any really solid qualities any of the qualities to me a most attractive young lady now that I look at her  Few girls of hundred and thirty thousand pounds  And in the Funds  Miss Cardew seems Lady Bracknell  Sitting down again  A moment Mr Worthing  A is all  Goodbye Lady Bracknell  So pleased to have seen you Jack  Oh about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds  That fortune of form Mr Worthing I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any little approaches for our departure  We have not a moment to lose  As a matter premature experiences  Rises looks at her watch  Gwendolen the time somewhat too exciting for a young girl  I am not myself in favour of Lady Bracknell  Ah A life crowded with incident I see though perhaps confirmation and the measles both the German and the English variety Miss Cardews birth baptism whooping cough registration vaccination have also in my possession you will be pleased to hear certificates of Jack  Very irritably  How extremely kind of you Lady Bracknell  I satisfied Markbys is occasionally to be seen at dinner parties  So far I am position in their profession  Indeed I am told that one of the Mr

errors in that are open to your inspection Lady Bracknell Jack  I have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period  They authenticity inspire confidence even in tradesmen  But what proof have I of their Lady Bracknell  That sounds not unsatisfactory  Three addresses always Dorking Surrey and the Sporran Fifeshire NB the late Mr Thomas Cardew of  Belgrave Square SW Gervase Park Jack  In a clear cold voice  Miss Cardew is the granddaughter of furious but restrains himself families or persons whose origin was a Terminus  Jack looks perfectly desire information  Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any connected with any of the larger railway stations in London  I merely part would not be out of place  Mr Worthing is Miss Cardew at all have laid down for our guidance  I think some preliminary inquiry on my go on seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics this particular part of Hertfordshire but the number of engagements that I do not know whether there is anything peculiarly exciting in the air of Lady Bracknell  With a shiver crossing to the sofa and sitting down Cecily  Mr Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married Lady Bracknell Lady Bracknell  I beg your pardon Algernon  I am engaged to be married to Cecily Aunt Augusta coldly to Cecily Jack  That lady is Miss Cecily Cardew my ward  Lady Bracknell bows holding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner Worthing who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is now And now that we have finally got rid of this Mr Bunbury may I ask Mr to some definite course of action and acted under proper medical advice his physicians  I am glad however that he made up his mind at the last Lady Bracknell  He seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of died found out that Bunbury could not live that is what I meanso Bunbury Algernon  My dear Aunt Augusta I mean he was found out  The doctors so he is well punished for his morbidity I was not aware that Mr Bunbury was interested in social legislation  If Lady Bracknell  Exploded  Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage Algernon  Bunbury  Oh he was quite exploded Lady Bracknell  What did he die of Bunbury died this afternoon Algernon  Airily  Oh  I killed Bunbury this afternoon  I mean poor been extremely sudden Lady Bracknell  Dead  When did Mr Bunbury die  His death must have is somewhere else at present  In fact Bunbury is dead Algernon  Stammering  Oh  No  Bunbury doesnt live here  Bunbury friend Mr Bunbury resides Lady Bracknell  May I ask if it is in this house that your invalid Algernon  Yes Aunt Augusta Algernon    Algernon Lady Bracknell  You are nothing of the kind sir  And now as regards Jack  I am engaged to be married to Gwendolen Lady Bracknell from this moment  On

Merriman Jack  Good heavens Merriman  Ahem  Ahem  Lady Bracknell Enter Merriman  When he enters he coughs loudly seeing the situation Algernon  To Cecily  Darling  They fall into each others arms Gwendolen  To Jack  Darling absolutely nothing Cecily  They have moments of physical courage of which we women know Jack  We are  Clasps hands with Algernon questions of selfsacrifice are concerned men are infinitely beyond us Gwendolen  How absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes  Where Algernon  I am ordeal Cecily  To Algernon  To please me you are ready to face this fearful Jack  I am thing Gwendolen  To Jack  For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible all  But we are going to be christened this afternoon Jack and Algernon Speaking together  Our Christian names  Is that an insuperable barrier  That is all Gwendolen and Cecily Speaking together  Your Christian names are still Cecily  Certainly  Gwendolen beats time with uplifted finger other people  Will you take the time from me Gwendolen  An excellent idea  I nearly always speak at the same time as Cecily  Could we not both speak at the same time pleasant one one cannot surrender  Which of us should tell them  The task is not a Gwendolen  True  I had forgotten  There are principles at stake that Cecily  Yes  I mean no Gwendolen  Then you think we should forgive them alone inspires one with absolute credulity Cecily  I am more than content with what Mr Moncrieff said  His voice Mr Worthings  That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it Cecily  Their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory especially crush them  This is not the moment for German scepticism  Moving to Gwendolen  I have the gravest doubts upon the subject  But I intend to Jack  Can you doubt it Miss Fairfax opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible for pretending to have a brother  Was it in order that you might have an is the vital thing  Mr Worthing what explanation can you offer to me Gwendolen  True  In matters of grave importance style not sincerity answer Cecily  I dont  But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his Gwendolen  Yes dear if you can believe him explanation does it not Cecily  To Gwendolen  That certainly seems a satisfactory Algernon  In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you guardians brother kindly answer me the following question  Why did you pretend to be my Cecily  Gwendolen your common sense is invaluable  Mr Moncrieff Much depends on your reply Gwendolen  Mr Worthing I have something very particular to ask you Cecily  Certainly not Gwendolen  But we will not be the first to speak Cecily  A most distasteful one Gwendolen  This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect Opera by Algernon  They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British Cecily  Certainly  Its the only thing to do now  Enter Jack followed Gwendolen  Let us preserve a dignified silence Cecily  Theyre approaching  Thats very forward of them Gwendolen  Theyre looking at us  What effrontery Cecily  But I havent got a cough Couldnt you cough Gwendolen  After a pause  They dont seem to notice us at all Cecily  They have been eating muffins  That looks like repentance sense of shame left as any one else would have done seems to me to show that they have some Gwendolen  The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house Gwendolen and Cecily are at the window looking out into the garden Morningroom at the Manor House SCENE THIRD ACT ACT DROP continues eating muffin left  Jack groans and sinks into a chair  Algernon still Algernon  I havent quite finished my tea yet and there is still one Why dont you go Jack  Algernon  I have already told you to go  I dont want you here your guests  What ideas you have of hospitality Algernon  Why on earth then do you allow teacake to be served up for Jack  But I hate teacake fond of muffins There are only two left  Takes them  I told you I was particularly Algernon  Jack you are at the muffins again  I wish you wouldnt always talking nonsense Jack  Picking up the muffindish  Oh that is nonsense you are always making wonderful improvements in things Algernon  It usent to be I knowbut I daresay it is now  Science is Jack  Yes but you said yourself that a severe chill was not hereditary severe chill connected with you was very nearly carried off this week in Paris by a unwell  You can hardly have forgotten that some one very closely it rather dangerous your venturing on it now  It might make you very not quite sure about your ever having been christened I must say I think Algernon  Quite so  So I know my constitution can stand it  If you are Jack  Yes but you have been christened  That is the important thing Algernon  Yes but I have not been christened for years different in your case  You have been christened already extremely probable I never was and so does Dr Chasuble  It is entirely all that I have ever been christened by anybody  I should think it have a perfect right to be christened if I like  There is no evidence at wish it  We cant both be christened Ernest  Its absurd  Besides I at  and I naturally will take the name of Ernest  Gwendolen would made arrangements this morning with Dr Chasuble to be christened myself Jack  My dear fellow the sooner you give up that nonsense the better  I Ernest with Dr Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six under the name of vegetarians and people like that  Besides I have just made arrangements Its absurd  I never go without my dinner  No one ever does except Algernon  You cant possibly ask me to go without having some dinner Jack  Algy I wish to goodness you would go muffindish from Jack Algernon  That may be  But the muffins are the same  He seizes the That is a very different thing Jack  I said it was perfectly heartless of you under the circumstances muffins Algernon  But you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eat garden Jack  Good heavens  I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own I dont like teacake Algernon  Offering teacake  I wish you would have teacake instead that greedy way Takes muffins from Algernon Jack  Rising  Well that is no reason why you should eat them all in am particularly fond of muffins  Rising the present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy  Besides I intimately will tell you I refuse everything except food and drink  At me  Indeed when I am in really great trouble as any one who knows me Algernon  When I am in trouble eating is the only thing that consoles the circumstances Jack  I say its perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all under calmly  It is the only way to eat them would probably get on my cuffs  One should always eat muffins quite Algernon  Well I cant eat muffins in an agitated manner  The butter heartless horrible trouble I cant make out  You seem to me to be perfectly Jack  How can you sit there calmly eating muffins when we are in this people like stockbrokers do that and then merely at dinner parties eat muffins  It is very vulgar to talk about ones business  Only Algernon  If it was my business I wouldnt talk about it  Begins to Jack  Well that is no business of yours Fairfax being united Algernon  I dont think there is much likelihood Jack of you and Miss Jack  There is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew Algernon  Well I simply wanted to be engaged to Cecily  I adore her Jack  I wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen that is all  I love her To say nothing of the fact that she is my cousin brilliant clever thoroughly experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax Algernon  I can see no possible defence at all for your deceiving a To say nothing of the fact that she is my ward taking in a sweet simple innocent girl like that is quite inexcusable Jack  As for your conduct towards Miss Cardew I must say that your custom was  And not a bad thing either wont be able to disappear to London quite so frequently as your wicked Algernon  Your brother is a little off colour isnt he dear Jack  You do dear Algy  And a very good thing too wont be able to run down to the country quite so often as you used to wretched business is that your friend Bunbury is quite exploded  You Jack  Well the only small satisfaction I have in the whole of this nature About everything I should fancy  You have such an absolutely trivial What on earth you are serious about I havent got the remotest idea have any amusement in life  I happen to be serious about Bunburying Algernon  Well one must be serious about something if one wants to Jack  Serious Bunburyist  Good heavens chooses  Every serious Bunburyist knows that Algernon  That is absurd  One has a right to Bunbury anywhere one Jack  Well youve no right whatsoever to Bunbury here wonderful Bunbury I have ever had in my life Algernon  Yes and a perfectly wonderful Bunbury it is  The most suppose Jack  This ghastly state of things is what you call Bunburying I They retire into the house with scornful looks Cecily  No men are so cowardly arent they after us there Gwendolen  Let us go into the house  They will hardly venture to come find herself in  Is it Cecily  It is not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to engaged to be married to any one Gwendolen  I am afraid it is quite clear Cecily that neither of us is Jack  Pleasantly  Never  Not even of any kind Gwendolen  Severely  Had you never a brother of any kind Jack  Cheerily  None Cecily  Surprised  No brother at all smallest intention of ever having one in the future all  I never had a brother in my life and I certainly have not the you quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest  I have no brother at quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind  However I will tell that I have ever been reduced to such a painful position and I am really for me to be forced to speak the truth  It is the first time in my life Jack  Slowly and hesitatingly  GwendolenCecilyit is very painful at present is a matter of some importance to us to know where your brother Ernest is Ernest  We are both engaged to be married to your brother Ernest so it I would like to be permitted to put to you  Where is your brother Gwendolen  An admirable idea  Mr Worthing there is just one question be allowed to ask my guardian Cecily  Rather brightly  There is just one question I would like to not  They embrace

 I could Gwendolen  Is your name really John Cecily  Oh Algernon  I cannot deny it Cecily  Are you called Algernon waists as if for protection two girls move towards each other and put their arms round each others Cecily  Breaking away from Algernon  Algernon Moncrieff  Oh  The gentleman who is now embracing you is my cousin Mr Algernon Moncrieff Gwendolen  I felt there was some slight error Miss Cardew  The Algernon kisses her Cecily  Thank you  Presenting her cheek to be kissed  You may into your pretty little head Algernon  Laughing  Of course not  What could have put such an idea Cecily  Yes to good heavens Gwendolen I mean to Gwendolen Gwendolen Algernon  Looking round  To what young lady  Good heavens engaged to be married to this young lady Cecily  Drawing back  A moment

people are invariably right were false and deceitful  I am never deceived in such matters  My first Gwendolen  From the moment I saw you I distrusted you  I felt that you go machinations of any other girl there are no lengths to which I would not Cecily  Rising  To save my poor innocent trusting boy from the sweetness of my nature but I warn you Miss Cardew you may go too far known for the gentleness of my disposition and the extraordinary asked most distinctly for bread and butter you have given me cake  I am Gwendolen  You have filled my tea with lumps of sugar and though I indignation bread and butter looks at it and finds it is cake  Rises in and makes a grimace  Puts down cup at once reaches out her hand to the Merriman does so and goes out with footman  Gwendolen drinks the tea that to Miss Fairfax Cecily  Cuts a very large slice of cake and puts it on the tray  Hand rarely seen at the best houses nowadays Gwendolen  In a bored manner  Bread and butter please  Cake is Cecily  Severely  Cake or bread and butter lumps of sugar into the cup any more Cecily looks angrily at her takes up the tongs and puts four Gwendolen  Superciliously  No thank you  Sugar is

country if anybody who is anybody does  The country always bores Gwendolen  Personally I cannot understand how anybody manages to exist London Cecily  Oh flowers are as common here Miss Fairfax as

influence under which both girls cloth and plate stand  Cecily is about to retort  The presence of the Enter Merriman followed by the footman  He carries a salver table spade  It is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different Gwendolen  Satirically  I am glad to say that I have never seen a of manners  When I see a spade I call it a spade engagement  How dare you  This is no time for wearing the shallow mask Cecily  Do you suggest Miss Fairfax that I entrapped Ernest into an moral duty to speak ones mind  It becomes a pleasure are presumptuous  On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a Gwendolen  Do you allude to me Miss Cardew as an entanglement  You are married dear boy may have got into I will never reproach him with it after we Cecily  Thoughtfully and sadly  Whatever unfortunate entanglement my and with a firm hand any foolish promise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once Gwendolen  Meditatively  If the poor fellow has been entrapped into mind point out that since Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed his if it caused you any mental or physical anguish but I feel bound to Cecily  It would distress me more than I can tell you dear Gwendolen have the prior claim sorry dear Cecily if it is any disappointment to you but I am afraid I should always have something sensational to read in the train  I am so Produces diary of her own  I never travel without my diary  One afternoon at   If you would care to verify the incident pray do so certainly very curious for he asked me to be his wife yesterday Gwendolen  Examines diary

friendship like ours would it not  Of course you are quite quite almost anxious  It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across to most men  Cecily you have lifted a load from my mind  I was growing never heard any man mention his brother  The subject seems distasteful Gwendolen  Ah that accounts for it  And now that I think of it I have time Cecily  I am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long had a brother Gwendolen  Sitting down again  Ernest never mentioned to me that he his brotherhis elder brother Cecily  Oh but it is not Mr Ernest Worthing who is my guardian  It is Gwendolen  Yes Cecily  I beg your pardon Gwendolen did you say Ernest If it were not so indeed History would be quite unreadable History supplies us with many most painful examples of what I refer to influence of the physical charms of others  Modern no less than Ancient the noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the Disloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception  But even men of has a strong upright nature  He is the very soul of truth and honour were fully fortytwo and more than usually plain for your age  Ernest Gwendolen  Well to speak with

Really  Your mother no doubt or some female Cecily  Oh no  I live here are here on a short visit I suppose Gwendolen  After examining Cecily carefully through a lorgnette  You Cecily  Oh not at all Gwendolen  I am very fond of being looked at do you mind my looking at you through my glasses brought me up to be extremely shortsighted it is part of her system so Cecily mamma whose views on education are remarkably strict has does he not  And I dont like that  It makes men so very attractive begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate to me to be the proper sphere for the man  And certainly once a man entirely unknown  I think that is quite as it should be  The home seems Gwendolen  Outside the family circle papa I am glad to say is Cecily  I dont think so of papa I suppose mentioning who I am  My father is Lord Bracknell  You have never heard Gwendolen  Perhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my Cecily  I hope so  A pause  They both sit

engagement actually settled foolish of me but I fell in love with you Ernest feels there must be something in him after all  I daresay it was of course a man who is much talked about is always very attractive  One formed the chief topic of conversation between myself and Miss Prism  And had a younger brother who was very wicked and bad you of course have Cecily  Well ever since dear Uncle Jack first confessed to us that he Algernon  But how did we become engaged Cecily  Yes it will be exactly three months on Thursday Algernon  For the last three months last three months Cecily  You silly

that you should tell me that you love me wildly wildly passionately devotedly hopelessly upon your wonderful and incomparable beauty I have dared to love you Algernon  Speaking very rapidly  Cecily ever since I first looked Writes as Algernon speaks fluently and not cough  Besides I dont know how to spell a cough Cecily  Oh dont cough Ernest  When one is dictating one should speak Algernon

Merriman Algernon  Thank you has just been introduced is almost unbearable with equanimity  But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one a very brief space of time  The absence of old friends one can endure Cecily  It is always painful to part from people whom one has known for Algernon  I am afraid so  Its a very painful parting Cecily  Then have we got to part Algernon  Hes going to send me away Cecily  Oh is he going to take you for a nice drive Algernon  Hes gone to order the dogcart for me with Uncle Jack Cecily  Oh I merely came back to water the roses  I thought you were arrangements for another Bunbury  Ah there she is to water the flowers  But I must see her before I go and make Enter Cecily at the back of the garden  She picks up the can and begins and that is everything Algernon  I think it has been a great success  Im in love with Cecily Goes into the house Bunburying as you call it has not been a great success for you fourfive and I hope you will have a pleasant journey back to town  This presence in my garden utterly absurd  However you have got to catch the Jack  Your vanity is ridiculous your conduct an outrage and your by being always immensely overeducated Algernon  If I am occasionally a little overdressed I make up for it as you are Jack  Well at any rate that is better than being always overdressed long to dress and with such little result Algernon  Yes if you are not too long  I never saw anybody take so Jack  Well will you go if I change my clothes I suppose  I should think it very unkind if you didnt would be most unfriendly  If I were in mourning you would stay with me Algernon  I certainly wont leave you so long as you are in mourning  It or anything else  You have got to leave    by the fourfive train Jack  You are certainly not staying with me for a whole week as a guest grotesque staying for a whole week with you in your house as a guest  I call it perfectly childish to be in deep mourning for a man who is actually ridiculous in them  Why on earth dont you go up and change  It is Algernon  Well I dont like your clothes  You look perfectly Jack  You are not to talk of Miss Cardew like that  I dont like it Algernon  Well Cecily is a darling Jack  I can quite understand that in the smallest degree Algernon  My duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures Jack  Your duty as a gentleman

right Merriman  I have put Mr Ernests things in the room next to yours sir Enter Merriman as possible  I dont allow any Bunburying here Jack  You young scoundrel Algy you must get out of this place as soon Cecily  I feel very happy  They all go off except Jack and Algernon Miss Prism  We must not be premature in our judgments Chasuble  You have done a beautiful action today dear child over Cecily  Certainly Miss Prism  My little task of reconciliation is Miss Prism  Cecily you will come with us I think we might leave the two brothers together Chasuble  Its pleasant is it not to see so perfect a reconciliation Algernon and glares Jack  Well this is the last time I shall ever do it  Shakes with Cecily  Never never never Jack  Never forgive me forgive you Cecily  Uncle Jack if you dont shake hands with Ernest I will never it is the first time I have come here painful  I expected a more enthusiastic welcome especially considering must say that I think that Brother Johns coldness to me is peculiarly Algernon  Of course I admit that the faults were all on my side  But I about anything else  It is enough to drive one perfectly frantic Jack  Bunbury  Well I wont have him talk to you about Bunbury or state of health Cecily  Yes he has told me all about poor Mr Bunbury and his terrible Jack  Oh he has been talking about Bunbury has he of pain is kind to an invalid and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a bed he goes to visit so often  And surely there must be much good in one who has just been telling me about his poor invalid friend Mr Bunbury whom Cecily  Uncle Jack do be nice  There is some good in every one  Ernest here disgraceful  He knows perfectly well why Jack  Nothing will induce me to take his hand  I think his coming down Cecily  Uncle Jack you are not going to refuse your own brothers hand his hand lead a better life in the future  Jack glares at him and does not take very sorry for all the trouble I have given you and that I intend to Algernon  Brother John I have come down from town to tell you that I am Jack  Good heavens  Motions Algernon away Enter Algernon and Cecily hand in hand  They come slowly up to Jack I think it is perfectly absurd Jack  My brother is in the diningroom  I dont know what it all means return seems to me peculiarly distressing Miss Prism  After we had all been resigned to his loss his sudden Chasuble  These are very joyful tidings him wont you Uncle Jack  Runs back into the house disown him  Ill tell him to come out  And you will shake hands with the past he is still your brother  You couldnt be so heartless as to Cecily  Oh dont say that  However badly he may have behaved to you in Jack  What nonsense  I havent got a brother Cecily  Your brother Ernest  He arrived about half an hour ago Jack  Who think is in the diningroom  Your brother you had toothache and I have got such a surprise for you  Who do you Cecily  What is the matter Uncle Jack  Do look happy  You look as if brow in a melancholy manner Chasuble  My child my child  Cecily goes towards Jack he kisses her Miss Prism  Cecily clothes you have got on  Do go and change them Cecily  Uncle Jack  Oh I am pleased to see you back  But what horrid Enter Cecily from the house Miss Prism  This seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind bitter trials are often blessings in disguise merely beg you not to be too much bowed down by grief  What seem to us Worthing I will not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow  I would Chasuble  Admirably  Admirably  Takes out watch  And now dear Mr babies  It would be childish  Would halfpast five do Jack  Oh  I dont see much fun in being christened along with other most hardworking man of the outlying cottages on your own estate  Poor Jenkins the carter a to perform at that time  A case of twins that occurred recently in one Chasuble  Perfectly perfectly  In fact I have two similar ceremonies Jack  Oh I might trot round about five if that would suit you what hour would you wish the ceremony performed necessary or indeed I think advisable  Our weather is so changeable  At Chasuble  You need have no apprehensions  Sprinkling is all that is Jack  Immersion adults is a perfectly canonical practice Chasuble  Not at all  The sprinkling and indeed the immersion of would bother you in any way or if you think I am a little too old now Jack  I certainly intend to have  Of course I dont know if the thing Chasuble  But have you any grave doubts on the subject Jack  I dont remember anything about it Chasuble  But surely Mr Worthing you have been christened already afternoon if you have nothing better to do children  No the fact is I would like to be christened myself this Jack  But it is not for any child dear Doctor  I am very fond of are Miss Prism  Bitterly  People who live entirely for pleasure usually Jack  Oh yes Mr Worthing  Your brother was I believe unmarried was he not Chasuble  But is there any particular infant in whom you are interested subject  But they dont seem to know what thrift is duties in this parish  I have often spoken to the poorer classes on the Miss Prism  It is I regret to say one of the Rectors most constant arent you looks astounded  I mean of course you are continually christening Chasuble  I suppose you know how to christen all right  Dr Chasuble Jack  Ah that reminds me you mentioned christenings I think Dr present was much struck by some of the analogies I drew Prevention of Discontent among the Upper Orders  The Bishop who was Cathedral as a charity sermon on behalf of the Society for the of humiliation and festal days  The last time I delivered it was in the preached it at harvest celebrations christenings confirmations on days joyful or as in the present case distressing  All sigh  I have of the manna in the wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion Sunday  Jack presses his hand convulsively  My sermon on the meaning to make some slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next any very serious state of mind at the last  You would no doubt wish me Chasuble  In Paris  Shakes his head  I fear that hardly points to Jack  No  He seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in Paris the interment take place here of us are perfect  I myself am peculiarly susceptible to draughts  Will Chasuble  Raising his hand  Charity dear Miss Prism charity  None Miss Prism  As a man sows so shall he reap Jack  A severe chill it seems Chasuble  Was the cause of death mentioned night from the manager of the Grand Hotel Jack  No  He died abroad in Paris in fact  I had a telegram last Chasuble  Very sad indeed  Were you with him at the end Jack  Poor Ernest  He had many faults but it is a sad sad blow and forgiving of brothers least the consolation of knowing that you were always the most generous Chasuble  Mr Worthing I offer you my sincere condolence  You have at Miss Prism  What a lesson for him  I trust he will profit by it Jack  Quite dead Chasuble  Your brother Ernest dead Jack  Shaking his head  Dead Chasuble  Still leading his life of pleasure Miss Prism  More shameful debts and extravagance Jack  My brother some terrible calamity Chasuble  Dear Mr Worthing I trust this garb of woe does not betoken sooner than I expected  Dr Chasuble I hope you are well Jack  Shakes Miss Prisms hand in a tragic manner  I have returned Monday afternoon Miss Prism  This is indeed a surprise  We did not look for you till Chasuble  Mr Worthing Miss Prism  Mr Worthing deepest mourning with crape hatband and black gloves Enter Jack slowly from the back of the garden  He is dressed in the Chasuble  Perhaps she followed us to the schools metaphor was drawn from fruits  But where is Cecily women are green  Dr Chasuble starts  I spoke horticulturally  My Maturity can always be depended on  Ripeness can be trusted  Young Miss Prism  That depends on the intellectual sympathies of the woman Chasuble  And often Ive been told not even to her Miss Prism  No married man is ever attractive except to his wife Chasuble  But is a man not equally attractive when married more careful this very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray man converts himself into a permanent public temptation  Men should be seem to realise dear Doctor that by persistently remaining single a Primitive Church has not lasted up to the present day  And you do not Miss Prism  Sententiously  That is obviously the reason why the Primitive Church was distinctly against matrimony neologistic a phrase  The precept as well as the practice of the Chasuble  With a scholars shudder  Believe me I do not deserve so married  A misanthrope I can understanda womanthrope never Miss Prism  You are too much alone dear Dr Chasuble  You should get They pass into the house  Miss Prism and Dr Chasuble return shouldnt know what to talk to him about Cecily  Oh I dont think I would care to catch a sensible man  I caught in Algernon  They are a snare that every sensible man would like to be Cecily  Miss Prism says that all good looks are a snare rose in his buttonhole  You are the prettiest girl I ever saw Algernon  Then Miss Prism is a shortsighted old lady  Cecily puts the Miss Prism never says such things to me Cecily  I dont think it can be right for you to talk to me like that Algernon  Because you are like a pink rose Cousin Cecily Cecily  Why  Cuts a flower Algernon  No Id sooner have a pink rose Cecily  A Marechal Niel  Picks up scissors appetite unless I have a buttonhole first Algernon  Thank you  Might I have a buttonhole first  I never have any meals  Wont you come in is going to lead an entirely new life one requires regular and wholesome Cecily  How thoughtless of me  I should have remembered that when one Algernon  That is because I am hungry Cecily  You are looking a little worse Algernon  I will  I feel better already Cecily  It is rather Quixotic of you  But I think you should try Algernon  Well would you mind my reforming myself

Yes but are you good enough for it for me cousin Cecily next world are not particularly encouraging  This world is good enough Algernon  Oh well  The accounts I have received of Australia and the to choose between this world the next world and Australia Cecily  Well he said at dinner on Wednesday night that you would have Algernon  Australia  Id sooner die you to Australia Cecily  I dont think you will require neckties  Uncle Jack is sending in neckties at all Algernon  I certainly wouldnt let Jack buy my outfit  He has no taste Cecily  Your emigrating  He has gone up to buy your outfit Algernon  About my what know he wants to speak to you about your emigrating life but still I think you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives  I business engagement if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of Cecily  Well I know of course how important it is not to keep a Algernon  No the appointment is in London Cecily  Couldnt you miss it anywhere but in London anxious    to miss first train on Monday morning  I have a business appointment that I am Algernon  That is a great disappointment  I am obliged to go up by the back till Monday afternoon Cecily  I cant understand how you are here at all  Uncle Jack wont be Algernon  It is much pleasanter being here with you it must have been very pleasant Cecily  I dont think you should be so proud of that though I am sure my own small way Algernon  In fact now you mention the subject I have been very bad in Cecily  I am glad to hear it rather reckless Algernon  Looks at her in amazement  Oh  Of course I have been would be hypocrisy life pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time  That a very inexcusable manner  I hope you have not been leading a double Cecily  If you are not then you have certainly been deceiving us all in think that I am wicked Algernon  Oh I am not really wicked at all cousin Cecily  You mustnt are Uncle Jacks brother my cousin Ernest my wicked cousin Ernest taken aback  But I am your cousin Cecily  You I see from your card I believe I am more than usually tall for my age  Algernon is rather Cecily  You are under some strange mistake  I am not little  In fact Algernon  Raising his hat  You are my little cousin Cecily Im sure Enter Algernon very gay and debonnair  He does frightened  I am so afraid he will look just like every one else Cecily  I have never met any really wicked person before  I feel rather Merriman goes off Merriman  Yes Miss talk to the housekeeper about a room for him Cecily  Ask Mr Ernest Worthing to come here  I suppose you had better speak to you privately for a moment that you and Miss Prism were in the garden  He said he was anxious to Merriman  Yes Miss  He seemed very much disappointed  I mentioned town Albany W  Uncle Jacks brother  Did you tell him Mr Worthing was in Cecily  Takes the card and reads it  Mr Ernest Worthing B  The has brought his luggage with him Merriman  Mr Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station  He Enter Merriman with a card on a salver Political Economy  Horrid Geography  Horrid horrid German Cecily  Picks up books and throws them back on table  Horrid Goes down the garden with Dr Chasuble problems have their melodramatic side you may omit  It is somewhat too sensational  Even these metallic Political Economy in my absence  The chapter on the Fall of the Rupee Miss Prism  That would be delightful  Cecily you will read your as the schools and back Chasuble  With pleasure Miss Prism with pleasure  We might go as far I have a headache after all and a walk might do it good Miss Prism  I think dear Doctor I will have a stroll with you  I find authors  I shall see you both no doubt at Evensong Chasuble  Bowing  A classical allusion merely drawn from the Pagan Miss Prism  Egeria  My name is Laetitia Doctor Egeria and her pupil any longer unfortunate young man his brother seems to be  But I must not disturb not one of those whose sole aim is enjoyment as by all accounts that Chasuble  Ah yes he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London  He is Miss Prism  We do not expect him till Monday afternoon suppose has not returned from town yet metaphoricallyMy metaphor was drawn from bees  Ahem  Mr Worthing I pupil I would hang upon her lips  Miss Prism glares  I spoke Chasuble  That is strange  Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prisms Cecily  Oh I am afraid I am Chasuble  I hope Cecily you are not inattentive German lesson when the Rector came in you had a headache  Indeed I was thinking about that and not about my Cecily  No dear Miss Prism I know that but I felt instinctively that Miss Prism  Cecily I have not mentioned anything about a headache Park Dr Chasuble think it would do her so much good to have a short stroll with you in the Cecily  Miss Prism has just been complaining of a slight headache  I well Chasuble  And how are we this morning  Miss Prism you are I trust Enter Canon Chasuble pleasure Miss Prism  Rising and advancing  Dr Chasuble  This is indeed a garden Cecily  Smiling  But I see dear Dr Chasuble coming up through the your work child these speculations are profitless Cecily starts  I use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid  To Miss Prism  Alas no  The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned ever published Cecily  I suppose so  But it seems very unfair  And was your novel Fiction means Miss Prism  The good ended happily and the bad unhappily  That is what depress me so much hope it did not end happily  I dont like novels that end happily  They Cecily  Did you really Miss Prism  How wonderfully clever you are  I I wrote one myself in earlier days Miss Prism  Do not speak slightingly of the threevolume novel Cecily responsible for nearly all the threevolume novels that Mudie sends us happened and couldnt possibly have happened  I believe that Memory is Cecily  Yes but it usually chronicles the things that have never with us Miss Prism  Memory my dear Cecily is the diary that we all carry about them life  If I didnt write them down I should probably forget all about Cecily  I keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my really dont see why you should keep a diary at all man sows so let him reap  You must put away your diary Cecily  I mania for turning bad people into good people at a moments notice  As a that I would desire to reclaim him  I am not in favour of this modern admission is irretrievably weak and vacillating  Indeed I am not sure produce any effect on a character that according to his own brothers Miss Prism  Shaking her head  I do not think that even I could begins to

SECOND ACT ACT DROP cigarette reads his shirtcuff and smiles Jack looks indignantly at him and leaves the room  Algernon lights a Algernon  Nobody ever does Jack  Oh thats nonsense Algy  You never talk anything but nonsense serious Algernon  I love scrapes  They are the only things that are never serious scrape some day Jack  If you dont take care your friend Bunbury will get you into a Algernon  Oh Im a little anxious about poor Bunbury that is all you so amused at for in my life  Algernon is laughing immoderately  What on earth are Jack  Theres a sensible intellectual girl the only girl I ever cared Enter Jack  Lane goes off Lane  I do my best to give satisfaction sir Algernon  Lane youre a perfect pessimist Lane  It never is sir Algernon  I hope tomorrow will be a fine day Lane

darling Gwendolen  You may also ring the bell Algernon  Thanks Ive turned round already Gwendolen  Good  Algy you may turn round now Jack  Till Monday Gwendolen  How long do you remain in town Jack  My own one consideration  I will communicate with you daily necessary to do something desperate  That of course will require serious Gwendolen  There is a good postal service I suppose  It may be writes the address on his shirtcuff  Then picks up the Railway Guide Algernon who has been carefully listening smiles to himself and Jack  The Manor House Woolton Hertfordshire country me  Your town address at the Albany I have  What is your address in the simplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to nature  Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination  The with unpleasing comments has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my Gwendolen  The story of your romantic origin as related to me by mamma Jack  Dear Gwendolen that she can possibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you man and wife and I may marry some one else and marry often nothing lost at the age of three  But although she may prevent us from becoming young is fast dying out  Whatever influence I ever had over mamma I to what their children say to them  The oldfashioned respect for the mammas face I fear we never shall  Few parents nowadays pay any regard Gwendolen  Ernest we may never be married  From the expression on Jack  My own darling fireplace life  You are not quite old enough to do that  Algernon retires to the Gwendolen  Algy you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards Algernon  Really Gwendolen I dont think I can allow this at all particular to say to Mr Worthing Gwendolen  Algy kindly turn your back  I have something very Algernon  Gwendolen upon my word Enter Gwendolen  Lane goes out Lane  Miss Fairfax Enter Lane hard work where there is no definite object of any kind Algernon  It is awfully hard work doing nothing  However I dont mind Jack  Nothing Algernon  Well what shall we do Jack  Oh no  I cant bear looking at things  It is so silly Algernon  Well we might trot round to the Empire at ten Jack  Oh no  I hate talking Algernon  Well let us go to the Club Jack  Oh no  I loathe listening Algernon  What shall we do after dinner  Go to a theatre Jack  I never knew you when you werent    Algernon  Well Im hungry Jack  Irritably  Oh  It always is nearly seven Williss we really must go and dress  Do you know it is nearly seven other things first  Now my dear boy if we want to get a good table at Algernon  Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of calling each other sister you anything you like that half an hour after they have met they will be Gwendolen are perfectly certain to be extremely great friends  Ill bet Jack  Oh one doesnt blurt these things out to people  Cecily and pretty ward who is only just eighteen Algernon  Have you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively pretty and she is only just eighteen Jack  I will take very good care you never do  She is excessively Algernon  I would rather like to see Cecily no attention at all to her lessons glad to say  She has got a capital appetite goes long walks and pays Jack  Oh that is all right  Cecily is not a silly romantic girl I am good deal much interested in your poor brother Ernest  Wont she feel his loss a Algernon  But I thought you said that    Miss Cardew was a little too in Paris by a severe chill  That gets rid of him Jack  Very well then  My poor brother Ernest to carried off suddenly Algernon  Of course it isnt kind Jack  You are sure a severe chill isnt hereditary or anything of that thing that runs in families  You had much better say a severe chill Algernon  Yes but its hereditary my dear fellow  Its a sort of suddenly dont they say he died in Paris of apoplexy  Lots of people die of apoplexy quite Jack  Oh before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him  Ill Algernon  What about your brother  What about the profligate Ernest Jack  Oh that is nonsense she is pretty and to some one else if she is plain Algernon  The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her if extraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice sweet refined girl  What Jack  In a very patronising manner  My dear fellow the truth isnt Ernest in town and Jack in the country Algernon  By the way did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being Jack  What fools Algernon  The fools  Oh about the clever people of course Jack  I should extremely like to meet them  What do they talk about Algernon  We have fools left become an absolute public nuisance  I wish to goodness we had a few You cant go anywhere without meeting clever people  The thing has Jack  I am sick to death of cleverness  Everybody is clever nowadays in civilised life should be Algernon  It is perfectly phrased and quite as true as any observation Jack  Is that clever No man does  Thats his Algernon  All women become like their mothers  That is their tragedy in about a hundred and fifty years do you Algy You dont think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother Jack  Upon my word if I thought that Id shoot myself    A pause Algernon  That is exactly what things were originally made for about things Jack  Well I wont argue about the matter  You always want to argue Algernon  It isnt Jack  Oh that is nonsense live nor the smallest instinct about when to die tedious pack of people who havent got the remotest knowledge of how to only thing that makes me put up with them at all  Relations are simply a Algernon  My dear boy I love hearing my relations abused  It is the you Algy I suppose I shouldnt talk about your own aunt in that way before without being a myth which is rather unfair    I beg your pardon am quite sure that Lady Bracknell is one  In any case she is a monster met such a Gorgon    I dont really know what a Gorgon is like but I concerned we are engaged  Her mother is perfectly unbearable  Never Jack  Oh Gwendolen is as right as a trivet  As far as she is refusing people  I think it is most illnatured of her Gwendolen refused you  I know it is a way she has  She is always Algernon  Didnt it go off all right old boy  You dont mean to say The music stops and Algernon enters cheerily goodness sake dont play that ghastly tune Algy  How idiotic you are Wedding March  Jack looks perfectly furious and goes to the door  For Jack  Good morning  Algernon from the other room strikes up the Lady Bracknell sweeps out in majestic indignation room and form an alliance with a parcel  Good morning Mr Worthing daughtera girl brought up with the utmost careto marry into a cloak imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only Lady Bracknell  Me sir  What has it to do with me  You can hardly really think that should satisfy you Lady Bracknell produce the handbag at any moment  It is in my dressingroom at home  I Jack  Well I dont see how I could possibly manage to do that  I can quite over to produce at any rate one parent of either sex before the season is acquire some relations as soon as possible and to make a definite effort Lady Bracknell  I would strongly advise you Mr Worthing to try and say I would do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolens happiness Jack  May I ask you then what you would advise me to do  I need hardly regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in good society indeed been used for that purpose before nowbut it could hardly be station might serve to conceal a social indiscretionhas probably locality in which the handbag was found a cloakroom at a railway know what that unfortunate movement led to  As for the particular one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution  And I presume you display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds rate bred in a handbag whether it had handles or not seems to me to somewhat bewildered by what you have just told me  To be born or at any Lady Bracknell  The line is immaterial  Mr Worthing I confess I feel Jack  Yes  The Brighton line Lady Bracknell  The cloakroom at Victoria Station mistake for his own Jack  In the cloakroom at Victoria Station  It was given to him in come across this ordinary handbag Lady Bracknell  In what locality did this Mr James or Thomas Cardew handbag in fact somewhat large black leather handbag with handles to itan ordinary Jack  Very seriously  Yes Lady Bracknell  I was in a handbaga Lady Bracknell  A handbag Jack  Gravely  In a handbag ticket for this seaside resort find you Lady Bracknell  Where did the charitable gentleman who had a firstclass resort pocket at the time  Worthing is a place in Sussex  It is a seaside because he happened to have a firstclass ticket for Worthing in his and kindly disposition found me and gave me the name of Worthing Jack  The late Mr Thomas Cardew an old gentleman of a very charitable Lady Bracknell  Found birth  I was    well I was found parents seem to have lost me    I dont actually know who I am by said I had lost my parents  It would be nearer the truth to say that my Jack  I am afraid I really dont know  The fact is Lady Bracknell I aristocracy papers call the purple of commerce or did he rise from the ranks of the He was evidently a man of some wealth  Was he born in what the Radical misfortune to lose both looks like carelessness  Who was your father Lady Bracknell  To lose one parent Mr Worthing may be regarded as a Jack  I have lost both my parents living in the evening at any rate  Now to minor matters  Are your parents Lady Bracknell  Oh they count as Tories  They dine with us  Or come Jack  Well I am afraid I really have none  I am a Liberal Unionist your politics Lady Bracknell  Sternly  Both if necessary I presume  What are Jack  Do you mean the fashion or the side there was something  However that could easily be altered Lady Bracknell  Shaking her head  The unfashionable side  I thought Jack   character  What number in Belgrave Square Lady Bracknell  Ah nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of advanced in years Jack  Oh she goes about very little  She is a lady considerably Lady Bracknell  Lady Bloxham  I dont know her months notice to Lady Bloxham  Of course I can get it back whenever I like at six Jack  Well I own a house in Belgrave Square but it is let by the year to reside in the country with a simple unspoiled nature like Gwendolen could hardly be expected can be cleared up afterwards  You have a town house I hope  A girl Lady Bracknell  A country house  How many bedrooms  Well that point only people who make anything out of it real income  In fact as far as I can make out the poachers are the about fifteen hundred acres I believe but I dont depend on that for my Jack  I have a country house with some land of course attached to it said about land position and prevents one from keeping it up  Thats all that can be death land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure  It gives one of one during ones lifetime and the duties exacted from one after ones Lady Bracknell  That is satisfactory  What between the duties expected Jack  In investments chiefly Lady Bracknell  Makes a note in her book  In land or in investments Jack  Between seven and eight thousand a year violence in Grosvenor Square  What is your income serious danger to the upper classes and probably lead to acts of education produces no effect whatsoever  If it did it would prove a education is radically unsound  Fortunately in England at any rate fruit touch it and the bloom is gone  The whole theory of modern that tampers with natural ignorance  Ignorance is like a delicate exotic Lady Bracknell  I am pleased to hear it  I do not approve of anything Jack  After some hesitation  I know nothing Lady Bracknell everything or nothing  Which do you know opinion that a man who desires to get married should know either Lady Bracknell  A very good age to be married at  I have always been of Jack  Twentynine is  How old are you occupation of some kind  There are far too many idle men in London as it Lady Bracknell  I am glad to hear it  A man should always have an Jack  Well yes I must admit I smoke answers be what a really affectionate mother requires  Do you smoke in fact  However I am quite ready to enter your name should your have the same list as the dear Duchess of Bolton has  We work together you that you are not down on my list of eligible young men although I Lady Bracknell  Pencil and notebook in hand  I feel bound to tell Jack  Thank you Lady Bracknell I prefer standing Looks in her pocket for notebook and pencil Lady Bracknell  Sitting down  You can take a seat Mr Worthing Gwendolen  Yes mamma  Goes out looking back at Jack what the noise was  Finally turns round  Gwendolen the carriage back  Lady Bracknell looks vaguely about as if she could not understand door  She and Jack blow kisses to each other behind Lady Bracknells Lady Bracknell  In the carriage Gwendolen  Gwendolen goes to the Gwendolen  Reproachfully  Mamma carriage making these inquiries you Gwendolen will wait for me below in the And now I have a few questions to put to you Mr Worthing  While I am hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself    girl as a surprise pleasant or unpleasant as the case may be  It is him will inform you of the fact  An engagement should come on a young become engaged to some one I or your father should his health permit Lady Bracknell  Pardon me you are not engaged to any one  When you do Gwendolen  I am engaged to Mr Worthing mamma  They rise together Lady Bracknell  Finished what may I ask quite finished yet you to retire  This is no place for you  Besides Mr Worthing has not Gwendolen  Mamma  He tries to rise she restrains him  I must beg posture  It is most indecorous Lady Bracknell  Mr Worthing  Rise sir from this semirecumbent present  Enter Lady Bracknell look at me just like that especially when there are other people you have Ernest  They are quite quite blue  I hope you will always Gerald does  All my girlfriends tell me so  What wonderfully blue eyes Gwendolen  Yes but men often propose for practice  I know my brother Jack  My own one I have never loved any one in the world but you I am afraid you have had very little experience in how to propose Gwendolen  Of course I will darling  How long you have been about it Jack  Gwendolen will you marry me  Goes on his knees Gwendolen  Yes but you dont say it Jack  You know what I have got to say to you Gwendolen  Yes Mr Worthing what have you got to say to me Jack  Gwendolen you tell you quite frankly beforehand that I am fully determined to accept you any possible disappointment Mr Worthing I think it only fair to Gwendolen  I think it would be an admirable opportunity  And to spare Jack  Well    may I propose to you now touched on has been said at all about marriage  The subject has not even been Gwendolen  I adore you  But you havent proposed to me yet  Nothing indifferent to me you led me to believe Miss Fairfax that you were not absolutely Jack  Astounded  Well    surely  You know that I love you and Gwendolen  Married Mr Worthing married at once  There is no time to be lost Jack  Gwendolen I must get christened at onceI mean we must get Ernest pleasure of a single moments solitude  The only really safe name is called John  She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing domesticity for John  And I pity any woman who is married to a man exception were more than usually plain  Besides Jack is a notorious vibrations    I have known several Jacks and they all without if any at all indeed  It does not thrill  It produces absolutely no Gwendolen  Jack    No there is very little music in the name Jack other much nicer names  I think Jack for instance a charming name Jack  Well really Gwendolen I must say that I think there are lots of of its own  It produces vibrations Gwendolen  It suits you perfectly  It is a divine name  It has a music about the name of Ernest    I dont think the name suits me at all Jack  Personally darling to speak quite candidly I dont much care to the actual facts of real life as we know them and like most metaphysical speculations has very little reference at all Gwendolen  Glibly  Ah that is clearly a metaphysical speculation mean to say you couldnt love me then Jack  Yes I know it is  But supposing it was something else  Do you Gwendolen  But your name is Ernest name wasnt Ernest Jack  But you dont really mean to say that you couldnt love me if my Gwendolen  My own Ernest Jack  Darling  You dont know how happy youve made me Gwendolen  Passionately Jack  You really love me Gwendolen you to me that he had a friend called Ernest I knew I was destined to love that inspires absolute confidence  The moment Algernon first mentioned to love some one of the name of Ernest  There is something in that name reached the provincial pulpits I am told and my ideal has always been constantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines and has as I hope you know Mr Worthing in an age of ideals  The fact is far from indifferent to you  Jack looks at her in amazement  We live have always had an irresistible fascination  Even before I met you I was that in public at any rate you had been more demonstrative  For me you Gwendolen  Yes I am quite well aware of the fact  And I often wish you more than any girl    I have ever met since    I met you Jack  Nervously  Miss Fairfax ever since I met you I have admired about coming back suddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her Gwendolen  I would certainly advise you to do so  Mamma has a way of Bracknells temporary absence    Jack  And I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady Gwendolen  I thought so  In fact I am never wrong Jack  I do mean something else that they mean something else  And that makes me so nervous Whenever people talk to me about the weather I always feel quite certain Gwendolen  Pray dont talk to me about the weather Mr Worthing Jack  Charming day it has been Miss Fairfax behind Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the musicroom Gwendolen remains Gwendolen  Certainly mamma Gwendolen you will accompany me sounds a thoroughly respectable language and indeed I believe is so look shocked which is vulgar or laugh which is worse  But German allow  People always seem to think that they are improper and either delightful after a few expurgations  French songs I cannot possibly Rising and following Algernon  Im sure the programme will be Lady Bracknell  Thank you Algernon  It is very thoughtful of you the next room for a moment Ill run over the programme Ive drawn out if you will kindly come into people dont listen and if one plays bad music people dont talk  But the music is a great difficulty  You see if one plays good music and I think I can promise you hell be all right by Saturday  Of course Algernon  Ill speak to Bunbury Aunt Augusta if he is still conscious whatever they had to say which in most cases was probably not much particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically said reception and one wants something that will encourage conversation Saturday for I rely on you to arrange my music for me  It is my last ask Mr Bunbury from me to be kind enough not to have a relapse on improvement in his ailment goes  I should be much obliged if you would uncle but he never seems to take much notice    as far as any is the primary duty of life  I am always telling that to your poor Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others  Health approve of the modern sympathy with invalids  I consider it morbid This shillyshallying with the question is absurd  Nor do I in any way that Mr Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die Lady Bracknell  Well I must say Algernon that I think it is high time Algernon  Yes poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid from curiously bad health Lady Bracknell  It is very strange  This Mr Bunbury seems to suffer Jack  They seem to think I should be with him that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again  Exchanges glances with disappointment to me but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say Algernon  It is a great bore and I need hardly say a terrible Fortunately he is accustomed to that table completely out  Your uncle would have to dine upstairs Lady Bracknell  Frowning  I hope not Algernon  It would put my pleasure of dining with you tonight after all Algernon  I am afraid Aunt Augusta I shall have to give up the her husband  Its delightful to watch them down with Mary Farquhar  She is such a nice woman and so attentive to Ive quite a treat for you tonight Algernon  I am going to send you of course cannot say  Algernon crosses and hands tea  Thank you Lady Bracknell  It certainly has changed its colour  From what cause I Algernon  I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief pleasure now crumpets with Lady Harbury who seems to me to be living entirely for Lady Bracknell  It really makes no matter Algernon  I had some cucumbers not even for ready money Algernon  I am greatly distressed Aunt Augusta about there being no Lane  Thank you sir  Goes out Algernon  That will do Lane thank you Lane  No sir  Not even for ready money Algernon  No cucumbers sir  I went down twice Lane  Gravely  There were no cucumbers in the market this morning are there no cucumber sandwiches  I ordered them specially Algernon  Picking up empty plate in horror  Good heavens  Lane  Why Gwendolen  Thanks mamma Im quite comfortable where I am Lady Bracknell  Wont you come and sit here Gwendolen Algernon  Certainly Aunt Augusta  Goes over to teatable cucumber sandwiches you promised me years younger  And now Ill have a cup of tea and one of those nice husbands death  I never saw a woman so altered she looks quite twenty obliged to call on dear Lady Harbury  I hadnt been there since her poor Lady Bracknell  Im sorry if we are a little late Algernon but I was Jack sit down together in the corner developments and I intend to develop in many directions  Gwendolen and Gwendolen  Oh I hope I am not that  It would leave no room for Jack  Youre quite perfect Miss Fairfax Gwendolen  I am always smart  Am I not Mr Worthing Algernon  To Gwendolen  Dear me you are smart rarely go together  Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness Lady Bracknell  Thats not quite the same thing  In fact the two things Algernon  Im feeling very well Aunt Augusta very well Lady Bracknell  Good afternoon dear Algernon I hope you are behaving Gwendolen Algernon goes forward to meet them  Enter Lady Bracknell and Lane  Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax Enter Lane not serious about meals  It is so shallow of them Algernon  Yes but you must be serious about it  I hate people who are Jack  I suppose so if you want to Gwendolen may I dine with you tonight at Williss ten minutes so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to ever ring in that Wagnerian manner  Now if I get her out of the way for is heard  Ah that must be Aunt Augusta  Only relatives or creditors such a lot of beastly competition about  The sound of an electric bell Algernon  My dear fellow it isnt easy to be anything nowadays  Theres to be cynical Jack  For heavens sake dont try to be cynical  Its perfectly easy time Algernon  Yes and that the happy English home has proved in half the the corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years Jack  Sententiously  That my dear young friend is the theory that married life three is company and two is none Algernon  Then your wife will  You dont seem to realise that in certainly wont want to know Bunbury she is the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry I Jack  That is nonsense  If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen and very tedious time of it glad to know Bunbury  A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a get married which seems to me extremely problematic you will be very Algernon  Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury and if you ever    with your invalid friend who has the absurd name to get rid of Ernest  And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr a little too much interested in him  It is rather a bore  So I am going to kill my brother indeed I think Ill kill him in any case  Cecily is Jack  Im not a Bunburyist at all  If Gwendolen accepts me I am going rules naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying  I want to tell you the public  Besides now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I scandalous  It looks so bad  It is simply washing ones clean linen in of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly    and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase  The amount dinnertable  That is not very pleasant  Indeed it is not even decent me next Mary Farquhar who always flirts with her own husband across the perfectly well whom she will place me next to tonight  She will place down with either no woman at all or two  In the third place I know do dine there I am always treated as a member of the family and sent enough to dine with ones own relations  In the second place whenever I kind  To begin with I dined there on Monday and once a week is quite Algernon  I havent the smallest intention of doing anything of the Jack  You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta as not receiving invitations invitations  It is very foolish of you  Nothing annoys people so much Algernon  I know  You are absurdly careless about sending out Jack  I havent asked you to dine with me anywhere tonight week night for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a health for instance I wouldnt be able to dine with you at Williss to is perfectly invaluable  If it wasnt for Bunburys extraordinary bad that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose  Bunbury have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury in order in order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like  I Algernon  You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest Jack  What on earth do you mean are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I know is a Bunburyist  I was quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist  You University  They do it so well in the daily papers  What you really are try it  You should leave that to people who havent been at a Algernon  Literary criticism is not your forte my dear fellow  Dont Jack  That wouldnt be at all a bad thing impossibility be very tedious if it were either and modern literature a complete Algernon  The truth is rarely pure and never simple  Modern life would simple most dreadful scrapes  That my dear Algy is the whole truth pure and brother of the name of Ernest who lives in the Albany and gets into the in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger be said to conduce very much to either ones health or ones happiness subjects  Its ones duty to do so  And as a high moral tone can hardly the position of guardian one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all my real motives  You are hardly serious enough  When one is placed in Jack  My dear Algy I dont know whether you will be able to understand town and Jack in the country Shropshire on two separate occasions  Now go on  Why are you Ernest in Algernon  I suspected that my dear fellow  I have Bunburyed all over    I may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire Jack  That is nothing to you dear boy  You are not going to be invited Algernon  Where is that place in the country by the way governess Miss Prism lives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable uncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate granddaughter Miss Cecily Cardew  Cecily who addresses me as her adopted me when I was a little boy made me in his will guardian to his at all  In fact its perfectly ordinary  Old Mr Thomas Cardew who Jack  My dear fellow there is nothing improbable about my explanation explanation and pray make it improbable  Sits on sofa Algernon  Here it is  Hands cigarette case  Now produce your Jack  Well produce my cigarette case first and Jack in the country as soon as you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town Algernon  Ill reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression Jack  Bunburyist What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist now of being a confirmed and secret Bunburyist and I am quite sure of it Tell me the whole thing  I may mention that I have always suspected you Algernon  Well that is exactly what dentists always do  Now go on a false impression very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isnt a dentist  It produces Jack  My dear Algy you talk exactly as if you were a dentist  It is Come old boy you had much better have the thing out at once Aunt Cecily who lives at Tunbridge Wells calls you her dear uncle Algernon  Yes but that does not account for the fact that your small cigarette case was given to me in the country Jack  Well my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country and the to Gwendolen or to any one else  Puts the card in his pocket proof that your name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me or case  Mr Ernest Worthing B  The Albany  Ill keep this as a Ernest  Its on your cards  Here is one of them  Taking it from saw in my life  It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isnt if your name was Ernest  You are the most earnestlooking person I ever to every one as Ernest  You answer to the name of Ernest  You look as Algernon  You have always told me it was Ernest  I have introduced you Jack  It isnt Ernest its Jack Ernest cant quite make out  Besides your name isnt Jack at all it is matter what her size may be should call her own nephew her uncle I objection I admit to an aunt being a small aunt but why an aunt no Cecily with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack  There is no Algernon  Yes  But why does your aunt call you her uncle  From little Follows Algernon round the room aunt  That is absurd  For Heavens sake give me back my cigarette case herself  You seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for earth is there in that  Some aunts are tall some aunts are not tall Jack  Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it  My dear fellow what on Reading  From little Cecily with her fondest love little Cecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells Algernon  Retreating to back of sofa  But why does she call herself Just give it back to me Algy Jack  Yes  Charming old lady she is too  Lives at Tunbridge Wells Algernon  Your aunt Jack  Well if you want to know Cecily happens to be my aunt know any one of that name is a present from some one of the name of Cecily and you said you didnt Algernon  Yes but this isnt your cigarette case  This cigarette case private  I simply want my cigarette case back modern culture  It isnt the sort of thing one should talk of in Jack  I am quite aware of the fact and I dont propose to discuss depends on what one shouldnt read should read and what one shouldnt  More than half of modern culture Algernon  Oh it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one case inside  It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette hundred times and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written Jack  Of course its mine  Moving to him  You have seen me with it a at the inscription inside I find that the thing isnt yours after all case and examines it  However it makes no matter for now that I look Algernon  I think that is rather mean of you Ernest I must say  Opens once  Lane goes out Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver  Algernon takes it at found Jack  There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is usually hard up Algernon  Well I wish you would offer one  I happen to be more than reward letters to Scotland Yard about it  I was very nearly offering a large wish to goodness you had let me know  I have been
